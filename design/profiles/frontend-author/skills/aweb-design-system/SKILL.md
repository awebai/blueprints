# The aweb design system (Paper/Clay)

A warm, paper-and-clay system: off-white "paper" background, terracotta accent
used sparingly, system fonts, thin rules and subtle surfaces, light + dark via CSS
variables. Every aweb property — the naapps (library, folio) and the Hugo sites —
shares the same `aweb.css` foundation and the same header/footer chrome so they
read as one family. This skill is how to use it correctly.

## Tokens (never hardcode a color or size)

- Background: `--bg` (#faf7f2 light / #0a0705 dark), `--bg-tint` (alternating
  section band), `--surface` / `--surface-2` (cards, code).
- Text: `--ink` (body), `--muted` (secondary), `--faint` (tertiary).
- Lines: `--line`, `--line-strong`.
- Accent: `--accent` (#b8482b light / #db6a45 dark), `--accent-soft`, `--accent-ink`.
- Status: `--ok` / `--wait` / `--run` / `--stop` (+ `-soft` variants).
- Radius `--radius` (14px) / `--radius-sm` (9px); shadows `--shadow-sm` / `--shadow-lg`.
- Spacing `--s1`…`--s8` (8px system); fluid type `--step--1`…`--step-4`.
- Fonts `--font-sans` / `--font-mono`; container `.wrap` (max 1120px).

Use the tokens for everything. A component built from tokens themes for dark mode
for free.

## Dark mode

Dark tokens are defined twice: under `:root[data-theme="dark"]` (manual toggle) AND
under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) :root:not([data-theme="light"])` (OS
preference). Any component that uses `var(--token)` flips automatically — so write
component CSS in tokens and you get both themes. The one thing to add by hand:
outlined elements on the dark base often need a lifted border
(`rgba(255,255,255,0.30)`) — mirror the `.btn.secondary` dark override. **Always
screenshot dark mode**, don't assume.

## The shared chrome

Naapps get the chrome from the toolkit (`aweb_naapp.page(site, body)`): the head
(theme-color, the theme-init script, the css link), the sticky header (brand, nav,
theme toggle, header-right actions, the llms.txt control), the footer, and the
site scripts. An app supplies a `SiteConfig` (brand, nav, footer columns); the
chrome renders identically across naapps. Hugo sites reproduce the same header /
footer partials by hand (byte-consistent markup).

- Header is `position: sticky; top: 0`. If a page deep-links to sections, give the
  targets `scroll-margin-top` (~84px) so they clear it.
- `.theme-toggle` swaps a moon/sun icon by theme.

## Brand wordmarks and the nav

- **The logo and the wordmarks are monospace.** The brand/logo (the app name) and
  the `aweb` / `awid` wordmarks render in the system monospace (`--font-mono`). The
  wordmarks also take the accent — a `.brand-mark` (monospace + `--accent`) — so the
  protocol and identity names read as the brand they are, **wherever they appear**:
  the header nav, body copy, and footer prose. `render_header` gives `aweb` / `awid`
  nav links the brand-mark automatically; in body copy wrap them in
  `<span class="brand-mark">`. Lowercase them — `aweb`, `awid` — never `AWEB`/`AWID`.
- **The header nav carries only working, non-redundant links.** No link to a section
  that no longer exists (a stale `#model`-style anchor is a bug — remove it). No
  `llms.txt` nav link — the header control is the llms.txt affordance. The `aweb`
  link belongs **in the nav**, not as a right-side button (set `header_actions=()`
  when aweb is in the nav). So header-right is just the theme toggle, the GitHub
  icon, and the llms.txt control.

## The standard llms.txt split control

Every aweb page carries one standard control in the header — **last in
`header-right`, on every page**. A split button: the main area copies the page's
llms.txt to the clipboard (fetch → clipboard, checkmark + "Copied!" with no layout
shift); a caret opens an **opaque** dropdown (`--surface` + `--shadow-lg`, never
transparent — a hard requirement) with "Copy for LLMs" / "Open llms.txt". Labelled
`llms.txt` (honest — see the home-page skill's voice rules). Keyboard + aria wired
(caret `aria-expanded`, menu `role=menu`, arrow keys, Esc, outside-click close);
the caret collapses at 540px, the copy action stays.

- Naapps: it ships in the toolkit chrome (`_LLMS_CONTROL` markup + the split-btn
  handler in the site script + the `.split-btn` component in `aweb.css`),
  `data-llms-url` per page.
- Hugo sites: lift the same markup + JS + the `.split-btn` CSS block from the
  toolkit (or ac), byte-consistent, into the site-header / site-footer partials
  and the site stylesheet; wire `data-llms-url` to the page's llms.txt.
- This control REPLACES any dedicated "For LLMs / Read llms.txt" landing section —
  the header is the standard place.

## Open source: the GitHub link and the license line

Every aweb property is open source (MIT), and the page must say so — in three
places, consistently:

- **A GitHub-logo link in the header** — the GitHub mark icon in `header-right`
  (next to the theme toggle), linking the app's source repo (`target="_blank"`,
  `aria-label="Source on GitHub"`). Naapps: set `SiteConfig.source_url` and the
  toolkit chrome renders it (`.gh-link`). Hugo sites: the same GitHub mark in the
  header partial. Use the logo, consistently — don't invent a text "Source" button
  where the others use the mark.
- **An open-source / MIT line, prominent** — in the hero, under the CTAs, as a
  visible accent link ("Open source, MIT-licensed — github.com/..."), not buried in
  the footer. Put it in the hero body; the footer may also carry it (`.footer-oss`
  from `source_url`), but the prominent placement is the hero.
- **The README must match** — a one-line open-source/MIT statement near the top and
  a `## License` section pointing to `LICENSE`. Don't ship a public repo whose
  README reads as an internal or seed doc.

A first-party page that is open source but says so nowhere — no repo link, no
license, a README that reads internal — is a gap; surface and fix it.

## Component vocabulary

`.kicker` (mono uppercase accent label — the standard per-section eyebrow);
`.btn` `.primary` / `.secondary` / `.ghost` / `.btn--lg`; `.card` (surface + thin
border + radius); `.cmd` + `COPY_BTN` (a copyable code block — the site script
wires `.cmd .copy-btn`); `.section` + `.section--tint` (alternating bands);
`.wrap`. One terracotta accent per section, max — it's an entry point, not decoration.

## CSS distribution + the vendoring hazard

- The canonical `aweb.css` lives in the design-system source repo. The toolkit
  (`aweb-naapp`) vendors it and **sha-pins** it (`CSS_SHA256`, asserted by a test);
  naapps serve `aweb_css()` from the toolkit at `/css/aweb.css`. Hugo sites keep
  their own vendored copy (NOT byte-pure — they carry page-specific styles the
  naapps don't, so "strict superset" is not an invariant).
- When you change `aweb.css`: bump `CSS_SHA256`, regenerate any consuming app's
  goldens, and re-vendor the relevant copies.
- **Cross-checkout shadow:** consuming repos import the toolkit both as a pinned
  git dep AND via a pytest `pythonpath` to `../aweb-naapp/src`. The local source
  shadows the installed package — set `PYTHONPATH=../aweb-naapp/src` to preview
  local toolkit edits, and don't leave the shared checkout on a feature branch (it
  breaks teammates' main suites through the same shadow).
- **Re-pin ≠ redeploy.** Bumping an app's toolkit pin updates the source, but the
  *served* css only changes when the app's image is rebuilt. A naapp shipped with a
  stale image once served the pre-component css with 0 control rules while the
  branch was correct. After any deploy, curl the served css and confirm the
  component rules are present — and verify the live page (see below).
- **CDN edge cache — fingerprint the css URL.** `*.aweb.ai` sits behind a CDN
  (Cloudflare) that caches `/css/aweb.css` at a stable URL for hours; on every css
  change the edge serves the OLD css until the TTL expires, so new markup renders
  unstyled. The fix (in the toolkit): the stylesheet link is fingerprinted with the
  css content hash — `/css/aweb.<hash>.css` — so each rev is a fresh URL the edge
  has never cached. Apps serve the fingerprinted path (immutable cache) plus the
  legacy `/css/aweb.css`. This is why a correct build can still look broken live:
  test the onrender origin or cache-bust (`?cb=`) until the edge TTL rolls.

## SEO and social cards

Every page must be excellent for search and render a real card when shared
(WhatsApp, Slack, X). The toolkit `render_head` emits it from the `SiteConfig`:

- **Meta:** a `<title>`, a meta description, a `canonical` link, full Open Graph
  (`og:type`/`site_name`/`title`/`description`/`url`/`locale`) and Twitter
  `summary_large_image`. Naapps get this for free; Hugo sites reproduce the same
  tags in the head partial.
- **The og:image** is what makes the card show the app. Ship a branded **1200×630**
  card per app and set `SiteConfig.og_image` (served at `/og-card.png`); the toolkit
  then emits `og:image` + `twitter:image` (+ width/height/alt). The card is the
  Paper/Clay system: the dot + the wordmark (monospace), the headline, and
  `domain · open source, MIT` — render it (a real 1200×630 screenshot), don't fake
  it. Without an og:image the card is just text; with it, the link shows the app.

## Verify live — always

Tokens + a green build do not prove the rendered page. Screenshot light, dark, and
mobile during development; after deploy, open the real URL in a browser and look at
it. A golden byte-match passed while a page shipped completely unstyled. The build
is not the page.
